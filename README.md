# LittleWings 🚀

DEPRECATED: LittleWings is a web application designed to manage and interact with Docker containers via a WebSocket-based interface. This project leverages the Sanic web framework to handle HTTP and WebSocket requests, enabling real-time communication and control of Docker containers.

## Features ✨

- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time interaction with Docker containers through WebSocket.
- **Docker Log Streaming**: Stream Docker container logs to the client in real-time.
- **Command Execution**: Execute commands on Docker containers via WebSocket messages.
- **Heartbeat Mechanism**: Keep the WebSocket connection alive with a heartbeat system.
- **Protected Routes**: Secure WebSocket routes with authentication.
- **Server Management**: Includes server management scripts for various actions.

## Works with ⛓️
- This project works hand in hand with its [Webapp UI](https://github.com/Daftscientist/project-1)

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites ✅

- Python 3.8+
- Docker
- Sanic
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation 🛠️

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Daftscientist/LittleWings.git
    cd LittleWings/src
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration ⚙️

Ensure that your Docker environment is properly set up and that you have the necessary permissions to manage Docker containers.

### Running the Application ▶️

1. Start the Sanic application:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. The application will run on `localhost` at port `8000`. You can change the host and port in the `main.py` file if needed.

### Usage 📡

- **WebSocket Endpoint**: `/api/ws`

    - **Connect**: Establish a connection and initialize the server instance with a container ID.
    - **Stream Logs**: Continuously receive log updates from the specified Docker container.
    - **Execute Command**: Send commands to be executed on the Docker container.
    - **Heartbeat**: Maintain the WebSocket connection by sending periodic heartbeat messages.

### Example WebSocket Messages 💬

#### Connect

```json
{
    "type": "connect",
    "server_id": "<your_container_id>"
}
```

#### Stream Logs

Once connected, logs will start streaming automatically.

#### Execute Command

```json
{
    "type": "command",
    "command": "<your_command>"
}
```

#### Heartbeat

```json
{
    "type": "heartbeat"
}
```

### Security 🔒

The WebSocket endpoint is protected by a custom `protected_route` decorator that checks for an `Authorization` header. Ensure to provide this in your request.
